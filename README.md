# Protein Gap Model Demonstration 
This is  demo of a protein structure based amino acid classifier using 3D convolutions. The central idea is to look at the environment of a query amino acid, remove the atoms the query amino acid and have the classifier attempt to predict the label of the missing amino acid given the environment defined as by the sphere around the C-alpha atom of the query amino acid. 

## Foundation for Transfer Learning
Given a well-trained classifier, the accuracy on a homology reduced test should be around 60 %. In this [paper](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6935-spherical-convolutions-and-their-application-in-molecular-modelling), they reason that the difference in the log-likelihood of a wildtype label and a mutant label must have some correlation with the change in stability upon that mutation. Furthermore, they found that they could add a down stream model on top of the classifier's output log likelihoods and gain additional performance on the prediction of protein stability change upon mutation.
